    text: `My name is Markus Reed. I am 35 years old with 3 beautiful kids. I am currently working as a deployment health analyst from the Army. Also, I am working as a church clerk at my fatherâ€™s church. 
    I am a business owner in the financial industry, where I help families achieve financial freedom and help create ownership. My goal is to serve the less fortunate and ensure our communities grow spiritually, mentally, and financially. 
    The goal is to consistently learn daily and help motivate others to pursue their dreams. The only difference between people is their mindset. I am in pursuit of changing lives and making a difference in society.`,
